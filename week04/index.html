        <p>This is a simple Tortilla Pizza recipe that was originally posted to cookieandkate.com. </p>

        <p>Instructions</p>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>Place the tortilla in a 12-inch cast iron pan (see notes  on baking surfaces below). Spread sauce evenly across the tortilla, leaving 1/2 inch around the edges. Sprinkle with cheese and toppings.</p>
        <p>Bake for 12-14 minutes, until the cheese is golden and bubbling (no sooner!) and the edges of the tortilla are lightly browned. Slice and serve.</p>
